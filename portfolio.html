       <h1>Lightbot is like a computer because they both mainly operate through inputs and outputs. For a computer, an input like pressing a key on the keyboard will result with an output where the corresponding key on screen. 
     For lightbot, an input of one 90 degree turn will cause an output of lighhtbot turning in one corresponding direction.Lightbot is also similar to a computer due to it operating in a systematic and consistent method, working purely off of 
     a changing state. Lightbot is differant from a computer because of how limited its actions are. Lightbot can only preform 5 actions in a maximum of two loops. A real computer can do much more.

      I agree that computing will transform society. Relative to the past decades before the digital age, Life was very differant from what it is today. Almost every industry has been redesigned. With 
      the rate at which computing has advanced in past years, one can only speculate how integrated society and computing will be in years to come. Information sharing will likely reach a record high, and will reform the education system 
      around the internet, furthering what is already happening in school. Online privacy will likely decrease every year due to the expanding nature of the internet, and the sheer amount of information that will be stored and eventually 
      indexed.</h1>

       <h2> <font color ="green"> <font size="+2"> Branching Conclusion Questions</font></font></h2>
       <p>1. Writing code in smaller pieces is benefical for troubleshooting, because if you submit a few lines of code at a time, it is much easier to find errors than if you're searching through the entire code at once for many errors. 
       <br> 2. Essay writing is similar to programming because both require repeated attempts at improving and clarifying your work before it serves its intended purposes. Programmers have to solve errors and simplify code. Essay writers 
       have to fix spelling, gramtical, and structural errors before their writing conveys their message.
       <br> 4. A dual core processor can seem to run 10 programs at once by running multiple programs simultaneously. The CPU's do not run more than one line of a single program at the same time, but can run one line from multiple programs
       almost instantaneously

       <h2> <font color ="green"> <font size="+2"> 1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</font></font></h2>
       <p> 1. Having very particularly namrf messages working with only one sprite at a time will cause less code and will make things clearer and easier to understand at a glance. <br>
       2. I believe events are the actions caused by the result of triggers like events, and handlers are the things, like sprites, that commit the action. <br>
       3. a) Some details of the play function are which sound is played on which instrament, and for how long.<br> 
       b) It would be useful to show how long a beat correlates to real time, for those musically untrained. It would also be useful to know how instraments are added, to allow for a larger variation of noises. </p>

       <h1> 1.1.5 Conclusion</h1>  
       <p>1. Using a fixed value for a variable makes the variables on a single line very simple to understand and change on a line by line basis. <br> </p>
         <pre> 2.
                If x = 1
                    play sound 1
                If x = 2 
                    play sound 2
                if key (space) held down
                    set x = 1
                else
                    set x = 2 </pre> <br> <pr>
           3. a) A fitbit and the lap count on a stop watch are examples of accumulators. <br>
           b)The accumulator raises its count every time the user takes a step, which classifies it as an accumulator. <br>
           4. The accumulator role raises a single value every time an action is completed. An aggregator role compiles a list of values, without combining them. </pr> <br>

            <h1> 1.1.6 Conclusion Questions</h1>
           <pr> 1. A stepper is a list of consecutive whole numbers. A walker is the message or value assigened to each level of the stepper. Best so far is the largest or smallest value of a certain variable that is stored, similar to a high score. <br>
           2.A pac man machine at an arcade recoredes a high score, which is an example of a best-so-far variable.</pr>
           <h1>1.1.7 <br>  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/177044159/">Scratch Math Game</a></h1>
           <p>This program was written in scratch. The purpose of the program is to solve a series of progressively harder math questions written in a “True/False” format. The
           video shows the first six levels of the program. It begins by asking if the player is there, and establishing a series of variables, one of which is called “level” and
           can be used to determine which level one is on. The video depicts the first 5 questions being answered correctly, and the transition from basic elementary school math
           concepts to algebra and eventually calculus. The sixth level is failed, which takes the user to a failure screen, where they must reattempt the game if they want to
           proceed further.

           <h1> 1.2.2 Conclusion</h1>  
           <p>1. The value of variables, and the differant costumes of sprites isn't shown in the scripts section. <br>
               2. The average person will be able to live a personalized digital experience, and programming and coding will progress much more rapidly once more people enter the field. </p>
            <h1> 1.2.3 Conclusionn</h1>
                <p>1. They both are a block coding language but app inventor has many more sensors and options and no "When flag is clicked" block. <br>
                2. A mobile device has differant sensors and takes more work to iterate versions out due to the long process of sending and downloading apps. </p>

	      <h1> 1.3.3 Conclusion Questions</h1>
	      <p>1. They are the commands the program runs if the requirements satisfy the if constraints <br>
	          2. True, False, and, or, not. And also is another boolean operator we never discussed.<br>
	          3.They all are right, but the time spent printing it twice is negligable, regarding Ira's claim. Jayla is correct that it is easier to edit it later if it's only in one instance. Kendra is also correct but the extra memory
	          is very small and irrelevant.</p>
	       <h1> 1.3.4 Conclusion Questions</h1>
	       <p>1. Glass box testing requires seeing the code to evaluate if it works, and if statements show which parts of teh code are executed. <br>
	           2. Only one path is executed, with each successive line of code being ran. No parallel if structures are ever ran. <br>
	           3. Test suites run every line of the code by following every path to make sure it works.</p>
	 <h1>1.3.8 Questions</h1>
	 <p>1. Insertion is the fastest method when sorting nearly sorted data. <br>
	     2. Merge sort takes the same amount of time with each data set. <br>
	     3. It would take a maximum of 9 and a minimum of 1 guess to find their birthday. <br>
	     4. The values will conflict and not reflect a total trend of something like "Higher" or "Lower" <br>
	     5. You know they are sorted because it is an easily searchable index. </p>
	 <h1>1.3.10 Game Theory</h1>
	 <p>1. In a game like rock paper scissors, you pick one of three options in order to beat the option pitted against you. When making formal seating arrangements for dinner events, you try to guess who pepole want to sit with. <br>
	     2. Abstraction is when complexity is layered within coding. An example of this would be creating a function that takes an argument, like a sorting algorithm, and calling it every time you want to sort something instead of rewriting
	     the code each time. It is useful because it eliminates much unnecessary code, and also when trying to change the algorithm, you only have to change the original function instead of changing it in each place it appears. <br>
	     3. In one of my programs, I imported the random function. Instead of having to program the function myself, I was able to shorten my code and make it simpler by importing a created function from a library. I called the random.randint
	     function, and gave it arguments, just after importing the function.</p>
	 <h1>1.4.2 Conclusion Questions</h1>
	 <p>1. Absolute filenames always describe a specific file name and location, while relative ones do not. <br>
	     2. A specific instance of a class with a specific set of values for its own attributes that is able to execute any methods defined in its class. <br>
	     3. Methods are instructions for an object, and properties are a sort of class member. <br>
	     4. The method does something to an object when called to one.</p>
	 <h1>1.4.3 Conclusion Questions</h1>
	 <p> 1. An image contains a series of lists. The first list holds a list of columns, which holds a list of rows, which holds a list of pixels which holds 3 rgb values, and occasionally an alpha value. <br>
	     2.A phone taken on a digital camera is seperated into pixels which are layed out in a grid. They both capture light <br>
	     3. These values are insignifigant because they are hidden within thousands of values. six bits are enough because the first bit holds 1, the second holds 2, the third holds 4, the fourth holds 8, the fifth holds 32, and the sixth holds 64. 
	     Counting 0, it maxes out at the 63rd number. This would change the image by having non similar colors near eachother, in order to maintain the code. <br>
	     4. These algorithms may note the similar colors near eachother by analyizng the differing color values, and the differance of color between differant objects, in order to group them into whole, seperate objects.</p>
